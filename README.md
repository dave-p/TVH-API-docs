# TVH-API-docs
User-created documentation for the TVHeadend HTTP API.

This document provides information on the HTTP API for TvHeadend. It was written from the source code of the development version 4.3.

The examples shown were generated from UK Freeview DVB-T / DVB-T2 using a single TV tuner. Other sources and multiple input devices may give different results.
### CAUTION
This API is an advanced feature of TVheadend, and the functionality is unstable and liable to change. The software does not completely validate its inputs and incorrect or unexpected calls may result in undesired behaviour.
